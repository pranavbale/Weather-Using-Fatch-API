Introduction
The Weather Project is a web application that displays the current weather information for a specified city using data fetched from a weather API. This documentation provides an overview of the project structure, technologies used, and instructions for setting up and running the application.

Technologies Used
The Weather Project is built using the following technologies:

HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling language used for designing the appearance of the web page.
JavaScript: Programming language for fetching weather data from the API and dynamically updating the webpage.
WeatherAPI: A third-party weather API used to retrieve current weather information.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page and includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.
styles.css: The CSS file that defines the styles for the web page elements.
script.js: The JavaScript file responsible for fetching weather data from the API and updating the webpage dynamically.
Setup and Configuration
To set up and run the Weather Project locally, follow these steps:

Obtain an API key: Sign up on a weather API provider (e.g., WeatherAPI) to obtain an API key. This key is necessary for making requests to retrieve weather data.
Clone the project: Download or clone the project files to your local machine.
Open index.html: Open the index.html file in a web browser or a code editor to view and modify the code.
Configure the API key and city: Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key and 'CITY_NAME' with the desired city name in the script.js file.
Save changes: Save the modified script.js file.
Run the application: Open the index.html file in a web browser to see the weather information for the specified city.
Usage
Once the Weather Project is set up and running, follow these steps to use the application:

Open the application: Launch the index.html file in a web browser.
View weather information: The application will display the current weather information for the specified city, including the temperature, condition, and humidity.
Refresh the page: To update the weather information, refresh the web page by pressing the browser's refresh button.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors while running the Weather Project, consider the following:

API key: Make sure you have provided a valid API key from a weather API provider and that it is correctly configured in the script.js file.
Network connectivity: Ensure that your internet connection is active and stable to fetch weather data from the API successfully.
Console errors: If you encounter any errors, check the browser console for error messages, which can help identify and resolve issues.
Conclusion
The Weather Project is a simple web application that demonstrates how to fetch and display weather data using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By following the provided documentation, you can set up and run the project locally to view the current weather information for a specified city. Feel free to modify and enhance the project according to your requirements or integrate it into larger applications.
